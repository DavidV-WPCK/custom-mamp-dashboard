# Custom MAMP Dashboard

**Tags:** MAMP, MAMP Pro, Dashboard | **Tested with:** v3.0+ | **License:** GPLv2 

The default MAMP (or MAMP Pro) dashboard is boring and not really all that useful for easily accessing your local development websites.
The Custom MAMP Dashboard allows you to easily add your websites complete with admin links, local dev links, and live site links.

These days I use Vagrant 80% of the time, but MAMP is still very useful and it's a real time saver to have my dev dashboard setup with projects currently under development.

**Requirements:** You must be running the MAMP or MAMP Pro app for Mac.

## Features

* Clean and organized code
* Very easy to implement  in just a few minutes.
* Fast easy access to your local dev sites and live sites.
* Easy to update as you add new dev sites.
